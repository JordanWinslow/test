# TypeScript Ecosystem Simulator Course Blank Project

It is highly recommended that you create this project from scratch instead of using this repo as your base, because you will learn a lot more about common project tools and get experience setting up bundlers, linting and other configs that are used by all web projects!

However if you just want to jump straight into the coding, already feel comfortable setting up these tools or run into trouble setting up the project yourself, feel free to use this template to get started!
